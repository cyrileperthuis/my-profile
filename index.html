   <p>
   Studient in Ieseg, I'd like to persue my studies in this business school because the 5 years diploma will allow me to choose who I want to be. Even if my hobbies are very diferent such as cooking, video games and travels, I would like to combine business and cooking to get the opportunity to excel in something that I really enjoy.

   <h2>Travels ‚úàÔ∏è</h2>
